## What is the YouTube Alive Chrome Extension?

YouTube Alive is a very basic Chrome Extension that:

* Loads all youtube comments where the related videos would be (on the right hand side of the video)
* Displays an icon in the addressbar that allows users to filter out comments without duration markers
* Sorts all comments with duration markers in ascending order
